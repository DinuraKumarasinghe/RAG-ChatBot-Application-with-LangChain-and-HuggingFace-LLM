# RAG Q&A Chatbot using DeepSeek + LangChain + HuggingFace

Welcome to my very first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application!  
This chatbot can **read any file** and answer your questions based on its content — just like a smart assistant trained on your own documents.

---

## 🚀 What is this project?

This is a terminal-based AI chatbot that:
- Reads a PDF document (like a resume, report, or article)
- Breaks it into chunks and creates embeddings (using HuggingFace)
- Stores them in a vector database (ChromaDB)
- Uses a powerful LLM (DeepSeek-R1) to answer any question based on the content

All powered by **LangChain**, **HuggingFace**, and **DeepSeek**!
